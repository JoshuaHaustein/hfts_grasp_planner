"""
    This module defines the Arm-Region-PlacementOrientation(arpo)-hierarchy.
    An arpo-hierarchy allows to search for an object placement with a dual arm robot.
    On the root level,the hierarchy has as many branches as the robot has arms, i.e.
    it represents the decision which arm to use to place the object.
    On the second level, the hierarchy has as many branches as there are placement regions
    in the target volume.
    On the third level, it has as many branches as there are placement orientations for the object.
    Subsequent hierarchy levels arise from a subdivison of the SE(2) state space of the object
    in a particular region for the chose placement orientation.
